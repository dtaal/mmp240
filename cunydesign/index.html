                    <strong>January 7, 2025 </strong><br>
                    Kingsborough Community College’s student journal of arts, “Antheon,” was named a 2024 American Graphic Design Awards winner in the “Student Work” category by Graphic Design USA (GDUSA). Once again, KCC was the only community college to receive this recognition.

                    Now in its 61st year, GDUSA’s annual showcase reflects graphic design’s power to shape and serve commerce and culture. The award is open to design firms and studios, ad and creative agencies, in-house departments, freelancers, students, and more. They received over 8,000 entries, of which nearly 800 were chosen. In addition to being featured on the GDUSA website, “Antheon” will be included in a printed catalog featuring the winners.</p>
