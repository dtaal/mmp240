        <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sazón with azafran</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>    
    </ul>

    <h2>Corn Dough Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups precooked yellow cornmeal masarepa</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon sazon Goya with azafran</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>    
    </ul>

    <!--Instructions-->
    <h2>Corn Dough Instructions</h2>
    <p>Place the masarepa in a large bowl. Add the sazon Goya and salt and stir to mix well. Add the water and oil and mix to form dough. Pat the dough into a ball and knead for 2 minutes or until smooth. Cover with plastic and set aside for 20 minutes. Meanwhile make the filling.</p>

    <h2>Empanadas Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the potatoes in a pot with water and the bouillon tablet for 20-25 minutes or until tender. Drain and gently mash the potatoes. Set aside.</li>

        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, heavy skillet. Add the onion and cook over medium-low heat stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, green onions, garlic, bell pepper, cilantro, salt and black pepper. Cook for about 15 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add the ground pork and beef. Cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, for 10 to 15 minutes or until the mixture is fairly dry.</li>

        <li>Transfer the meat mixture to the mashed potatoes bowl and mix well to combine.</li>

        <li>Break small portions of the dough, about 1 ½ tablespoons each one, and form each portion into a ball by rolling between the palms of your hands.</li>

        <li>Place the balls of dough between two pieces of plastic and roll each out very thinly to form a circle. Remove the top plastic and place 1 tablespoon of the filling in the center of each.</li>

        <li>Then using the plastic underneath, fold the dough over to enclose the filling, forming a half circle. Tightly seal the edges by crimping with the tines of a fork.</li>

        <li>Fill a large pot with vegetable oil and heat over medium heat to 360° F.</li>

        <li>Carefully place 3 or 4 empanadas at the time in the heated oil and fry for about 2 minutes until golden on all sides.</li>

    </ol>
